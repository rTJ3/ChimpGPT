Inspired by the original Masked Span Task Game, I bring you ChimpGPT.

The Masked Span Task Game was used to measure a Chimpanzee's memory of numerals vs Humans, in the Kyoto University research study in 2007.

The aim of this mini project was to have a little fun and see whether it would be possible to create a simple app.

After seeing GPT3 and 4s creations of classics like Pong, the Chimpanzee study game inspired this recreation. The entire game was created - prompted - from scratch with ChatGPT Plus by a non-coder. I knew nothing about the originial study and only learned about it in passing online. It is my first app. 

While theres no GPT'ness about this game, I'm calling it ChimpGPT as a hat tip to both the original study and the amazing tool OpenAI has created.
